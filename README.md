# Product Management Course Notes
My notes from a Coursera course, Digital Product Management (University of Virginia/Coursera) by Alexander Cowan. 
Really good course, worth taking.

Anyone is welcome to use these, but they are simply some of my takeaways. You really need to do the course yourself to get the full content, meaning and relevance.
